# Quick Start Guide for Securing API Keys on Netlify

## What Has Been Done

Your LocalExplorer application has been secured! All API keys have been moved from client-side code to secure serverless functions. This means:

✅ **API keys are no longer exposed in the browser**
✅ **Keys are stored securely as Netlify environment variables**
✅ **Your app now uses Netlify Functions to proxy API requests**

## Files Changed

- ✨ **New**: `netlify/functions/` - 7 serverless functions created
- ✨ **New**: `netlify.toml` - Netlify configuration
- ✨ **New**: `.gitignore` - Prevents committing sensitive files
- ✨ **New**: `.env.example` - Template for environment variables
- ✨ **New**: `SECURITY_SETUP.md` - Detailed setup instructions
- 🔧 **Modified**: `key.js` - Removed hardcoded API keys
- 🔧 **Modified**: `js/api.js` - Updated to use Netlify Functions

## Next Steps (Action Required!)

### 1. Set Environment Variables in Netlify

Go to your Netlify site dashboard:
1. Click **Site settings**
2. Navigate to **Environment variables** (in the sidebar)
3. Click **Add a variable** and add each of these:

```
MAPS_API_KEY = your_google_maps_api_key
TICKETMASTER_API_KEY = your_ticketmaster_api_key
HOLIDAY_API_KEY = your_holiday_api_key
WHAT3WORDS_API_KEY = your_what3words_api_key
FOURSQUARE_API_KEY = your_foursquare_api_key
EBIRD_API_KEY = your_ebird_api_key
RECREATION_GOV_API_KEY = your_recreation_gov_api_key
NPS_API_KEY = your_nps_api_key
```

**Replace the values with your actual API keys!**

### 2. Where to Get API Keys

If you don't have these keys yet, see the **SECURITY_SETUP.md** file for links to obtain each one.

### 3. Redeploy Your Site

After adding the environment variables:
1. Go to **Deploys** in your Netlify dashboard
2. Click **Trigger deploy** → **Deploy site**
3. Wait for the deployment to complete

### 4. Test Your Application

Once deployed, test these features:
- ✅ Events (Ticketmaster)
- ✅ Bird sightings (eBird)
- ✅ Holiday alerts (HolidayAPI)
- ✅ Location addressing (What3Words)
- ✅ Place searches (Foursquare)
- ✅ Recreation areas (Recreation.gov)
- ✅ National parks (NPS)

## Important Security Notes

🔐 **Never commit API keys to Git** - The `.gitignore` file now prevents this

🔐 **The old `key.js` with hardcoded keys is still in your Git history** - Consider rotating all API keys if they were previously committed

🔐 **Monitor your API usage** - Check your API provider dashboards regularly

## For Local Development

To test locally:

```bash
# Install Netlify CLI
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Create .env file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env and add your API keys
nano .env  # or use your preferred editor

# Run locally
netlify dev
```
