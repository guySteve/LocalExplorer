# Testing Guide for Weather, Birds, and List/Plan Fixes

This document outlines how to test the fixes for weather, birds, and list/plan integration.

## ✅ Fixed Issues

### 1. Weather Clarification
**Issue**: User thought weather needed an API key
**Fix**: Clarified that weather uses Open-Meteo which is FREE and requires NO API KEY

### 2. Birds Error Handling  
**Issue**: Birds feature failed silently without EBIRD_API_KEY
**Fix**: Added helpful error message with instructions when API key is missing

### 3. List/Plan Tab Switching
**Issue**: Tab switching functions weren't accessible from shared plan feature
**Fix**: Moved switchToListView and switchToPlanView to module scope
