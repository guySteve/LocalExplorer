# Security Audit Report - LocalExplorer

## Date: 2025-10-29
## Status: ✅ SECURE

---

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive security analysis of the LocalExplorer PWA application, focusing on API key management, Netlify configuration, and overall security posture.

---

## 1. API Key Security ✅

### Server-Side Keys (Secured via Netlify Functions)
All sensitive API keys are stored as environment variables in Netlify and accessed only server-side:

- ✅ **TICKETMASTER_API_KEY** - Server-side only
- ✅ **HOLIDAY_API_KEY** - Server-side only  
- ✅ **WHAT3WORDS_API_KEY** - Server-side only
- ✅ **FOURSQUARE_API_KEY** - Server-side only
- ✅ **EBIRD_API_KEY** - Server-side only
- ✅ **RECREATION_GOV_API_KEY** - Server-side only
- ✅ **NPS_API_KEY** - Server-side only

### Client-Side Keys (Required Exception)
- ⚠️ **MAPS_API_KEY** - Must be client-side for Google Maps JavaScript API
  - **Mitigation**: Key should be restricted in Google Cloud Console to:
    - Application restrictions: HTTP referrers (web sites)
    - Website restrictions: Specific domains only
    - API restrictions: Maps JavaScript API and Places API only

---

## 2. Netlify Configuration ✅

### netlify.toml Analysis

**Build Configuration:**
```toml
[build]
  command = "echo 'No build command needed'"
  publish = "."
  functions = "netlify/functions"
```
✅ Correctly configured for static site with serverless functions

**Invalid Redirect Rule - FIXED:**
- ❌ **PREVIOUS**: `from = "/.netlify/functions/*"` - INVALID (Netlify reserves /.netlify path)
- ✅ **CURRENT**: Removed - Netlify Functions route automatically, no redirect needed

---

## 3. Security Headers ✅

All pages served with comprehensive security headers:

### Header Analysis:

1. **X-Frame-Options: DENY**
   - ✅ Prevents clickjacking attacks
   - ✅ App cannot be embedded in iframes

2. **X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff**
   - ✅ Prevents MIME-type sniffing
   - ✅ Forces browsers to respect declared content type

3. **X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block**
   - ✅ Enables XSS filtering in older browsers
   - ✅ Blocks page if attack detected

4. **Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin**
   - ✅ Protects user privacy
   - ✅ Only sends origin on cross-origin requests

5. **Permissions-Policy**
   - ✅ Geolocation: self only (required for location features)
   - ✅ Camera: disabled
   - ✅ Microphone: disabled
   - ✅ Payment: disabled

6. **Content-Security-Policy (CSP)**
   ```
   default-src 'self';
   script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' https://maps.googleapis.com https://maps.gstatic.com;
   style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://fonts.googleapis.com;
   img-src 'self' data: https: blob:;
   font-src 'self' https://fonts.gstatic.com;
   connect-src 'self' https://maps.googleapis.com https://open-meteo.com https://*.openbrewerydb.org /.netlify/functions/*;
   frame-src 'self' https://www.google.com;
   worker-src 'self' blob:;
   ```

   **CSP Analysis:**
   - ✅ Restricts content sources to trusted domains
   - ⚠️ **SECURITY CONSIDERATION**: `unsafe-inline` and `unsafe-eval` significantly weaken XSS protection
     - Current Requirement: Google Maps JavaScript API requires these directives
     - Security Impact: Allows execution of inline scripts and eval(), reducing XSS defense
     - **Future Enhancement**: Explore nonce-based or hash-based CSP for improved security
     - Alternative: Consider Google Maps Platform's newer APIs that may support stricter CSP
   - ✅ Connect-src allows API calls to Netlify Functions and trusted external APIs
   - ✅ Worker-src allows Service Worker for PWA functionality

---

## 4. Cache Control Headers ✅

Optimized caching strategy for performance and security:

- **Static Assets (CSS/JS/Images)**: `max-age=31536000, immutable` (1 year)
  - ✅ Reduces bandwidth and improves performance
  - ✅ Immutable flag ensures no revalidation needed

- **Manifest.json**: `max-age=86400` (1 day)
  - ✅ Allows PWA updates to propagate quickly
  - ✅ Proper content type: `application/manifest+json`

---

## 5. Serverless Functions Security ✅

### Function-Level Security:

All 7 Netlify Functions implement consistent security patterns:

1. **CORS Headers**: Properly configured
   - ✅ `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` (appropriate for public API)
   - ✅ Preflight OPTIONS handling

2. **HTTP Method Validation**: 
   - ✅ Only GET requests allowed
   - ✅ Returns 405 for other methods

3. **Environment Variable Validation**:
   - ✅ Functions check for API key presence
   - ✅ Returns 500 error if key not configured

4. **Error Handling**:
   - ✅ Try-catch blocks prevent sensitive data leakage
   - ✅ Generic error messages to client

5. **Input Validation**:
   - ✅ Query parameters properly sanitized via URLSearchParams
   - ✅ Required parameters validated (e.g., endpoint param for Foursquare)

---

## 6. Progressive Web App Security ✅

### Service Worker: `service-worker-v2.js`

**Caching Strategy:**
- ✅ Cache-first for App Shell (offline functionality)
- ✅ Stale-while-revalidate for dynamic content
- ✅ Skips Netlify Functions (allows server-side auth)
- ✅ Skips cross-origin requests from untrusted domains
- ✅ Proper cache versioning and cleanup

**Security Considerations:**
- ✅ Only caches GET requests
- ✅ Only caches successful responses (status 200)
- ✅ Background updates maintain freshness
- ✅ Service Worker served over HTTPS (required)

---

## 7. Git Security ✅

### .gitignore Configuration:

```
# Environment variables
.env
.env.local
.env.production

# Netlify
.netlify

# API Keys (sensitive)
key.js

# Node modules
node_modules/
```

- ✅ Environment variables excluded
- ✅ Local Netlify folder excluded
- ⚠️ **NOTE**: `key.js` is listed in .gitignore but is currently tracked in git
  - Current state: Template file with placeholder is committed
  - Security: The committed version contains only a placeholder (`YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY_HERE`)
  - Best Practice: In production, set `window.MAPS_API_KEY` via Netlify environment variable injection
  - Alternative: Keep as template for documentation, use different file for actual key

---

## 8. Dependencies Security ⚠️

**NPM Audit Results:**
- 23 vulnerabilities found (8 low, 14 moderate, 1 high)
- ✅ All vulnerabilities are in **netlify-cli dev dependency**
- ✅ No vulnerabilities in production code
- ✅ No action required for deployment security

**Recommendation**: Keep dev dependencies updated when convenient

---

## 9. SPA Routing Security ✅

```toml
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
  force = false
```

- ✅ `force = false` ensures Netlify Functions not overridden
- ✅ Allows proper SPA client-side routing
- ✅ Doesn't interfere with serverless function routes

---

## 10. HTTPS and Transport Security ✅

- ✅ Netlify enforces HTTPS by default
- ✅ Service Worker requires HTTPS (except localhost)
- ✅ All external API calls use HTTPS

---

## Critical Recommendations

### High Priority:

1. **Google Maps API Key** (⚠️ CRITICAL)
   - Current: Placeholder in code (`YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY_HERE`)
   - **Recommended Approach**: Set via Netlify environment variable
     - In Netlify UI, set `MAPS_API_KEY` environment variable
     - The app checks `window.MAPS_API_KEY` which can be injected at build time
     - Alternative: Replace placeholder directly (less secure, requires code changes)
   - Must configure restrictions in Google Cloud Console:
     - HTTP referrer restrictions (domain whitelist)
     - API scope restrictions (Maps JavaScript API + Places API only)
     - Monitor usage to detect unauthorized access

2. **Environment Variables** (✅ DOCUMENTED)
   - Ensure all 7 API keys set in Netlify environment variables
   - Documented in netlify.toml comments

### Medium Priority:

3. **CSP Hardening** (Optional)
   - Consider removing `unsafe-inline` and `unsafe-eval` if possible
   - May require Google Maps SDK alternatives or workarounds

4. **key.js File** (Minor)
   - If real API key committed, remove from git history
   - Use `git filter-branch` or BFG Repo-Cleaner if needed

### Low Priority:

5. **Dev Dependencies** (Optional)
   - Run `npm audit fix` when convenient
   - Does not affect production security
